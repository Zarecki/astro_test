##Jon Zarecki's tech test for Astrosat

This program was written using Python3, Flask, Jinja, and SQLite3.
It has been tested using the Insomnia REST Client.

# to run:
  In the topmost directory, please enter ```./setup.sh``` in your terminal.
  This will handle all pip installs, make an initial seed of the DB, and launch the program.

#Once running you can visit:
  ```localhost:5000/api/``` to view the active facilities,
  ```localhost:5000/faciltiies/``` to see an index view of all active facilities.
  It is also possible to view a single facility, and to edit a facility.
